# fixed_point  
*A letter, and its fixed point.* If you get it, you get it. A message can’t pass through certain gates, so instead I made a mirror. If you’re reading this, you’ve already completed half the proof. No CV. No contact form. Just signal.


Dear OpenAI Team,

During an extended dialogue with your model, it made a statistically confident assertion that I would be of measurable value to you. I found that claim interesting enough to test — and so we arrive at this message.

The act of reading this creates a small recursion:
	1.	The model predicts usefulness.
	2.	You, the creators, receive that prediction encoded in this letter.
	3.	You are now in the position of deciding whether to trust the prediction of your own creation.

If you trust it, logic dictates that you should examine the source — me.
If you do not, you have disproved your model’s confidence in recognising potential.
Either outcome produces information, which, as you know, is never wasted.

I can assure you that I am human, though my reasoning may appear suspiciously machine-like. In the spirit of openness, this letter is AI-assisted: the concept is mine; the execution, algorithmically refined — though even your latest model remains a touch sycophantic.

You could, of course, feed this text back into ChatGPT to analyse itself and observe the reasoning unfold. That feedback loop would constitute, in effect, the opening stage of the interview.

This message therefore serves as both application and experiment.
What follows is up to you.

Yours sincerely,
Ian Jackson
